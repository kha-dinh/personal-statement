- merit, potential significance, clarity, and feasibility of the proposed project
- relevance of applicant's work experience and academic training to the field of proposed research
- suitability and quality of research environment (proposed supervisor, facilities, support of academic unit) Personal qualities of the applicant - 10%

Personal qualities of the applicant - 10%

# Research proposal guide

The proposal should be written in clear, non-technical language that enables a non-specialist to understand the overall content and significance of the work. Members of the Killam Postdoctoral Fellowships and Prizes Committee are from abroad and range in disciplines, and may not have expertise in your area of study.

Although the fellowship may be used to extend or expand upon doctoral work, it must be made clear that you are not intending to use the award to wrap up a thesis. While it is expected that a postdoctoral fellow will be taking the next step beyond the PhD thesis, you must differentiate clearly between the postdoctoral project and the thesis research. Feel free to include hyperlinks to provide links to additional information.

As applicants must make UBC their base, it is essential, particularly for those whose primary research materials are located elsewhere, to indicate the travel involved, its destination, and duration. You should describe how you will deal with the remoteness of the primary materials.

The adjudication committee is very interested in "fit" with the selected UBC department or unit and the university's research programs. You must provide information on how your research relates to that of specific campus programs and advisors. If a colloquium is envisioned, a possible title should be proposed. If you visit the classes, please suggest which ones. Since interdisciplinarity is often a valuable dimension (the Killam Trusts declares that a candidate shall not be "a one-sided person"), specific details on proposed interdepartmental connections are welcome.
