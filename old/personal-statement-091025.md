I first became fascinated with systems security in the final year of my undergraduate studies at Hochiminh University of Technology, Vietnam, where I learned about the [Spectre and Meltdown attacks](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42564461), which shook the world in 2018. These attacks demonstrated how _out-of-order execution_, a feature ubiquitous in modern processors for performance, could be exploited through _side-channel attacks_ to leak secrets like personal passwords. Two things struck me: the arcane complexity of modern processors, and the fragile security foundations upon which we build our computing systems! Being naturally drawn to complex systems and challenging problems, I delved deeper into the world of cybersecurity, which began with my Bachelor's thesis on secure data crowdsourcing. Coming from a developing country with limited access to advanced education, I looked for opportunities abroad and joined [Systems Security Lab (SSLab)](https://sslab.skku.edu/) at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU), South Korea, as a Ph.D. student.

From 2019 to 2025, at SSLab, I practiced the art of designing secure systems and made several contributions to systems security research.
One of my proudest moments was having my paper recognized with the **Distinguished Paper Award** at the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security 2023. Eventually, I got to address side-channel vulnerabilities, the very class of attack that first drew me into systems security. The work, titled IncognitOS, appeared at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy 2025, often regarded as the field's most prestigious conference. This is a milestone that once felt far beyond reach when I first began. This journey has not only prepared me as a competent researcher; it also made me realize that systems security is not a solitary pursuit, but a collective one; my achievements were possible only because of the ideas, critiques, and encouragement I received from others.

Yet, I have learnt that fruitful collaborations are not free; you have to actively seek them and be persistent. As Richard Hamming noted in [his lecture](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html), the scientists who work with their doors open and allow interruptions often make the most impactful contributions. Conducting research in a geographically isolated environment with limited collaboration opportunities motivated me to be proactive: I sought out international projects with collaborators worldwide, including one project with UBC's [Systopia lab](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/). I contributed to the broader field through service on artifact evaluation and poster committees at major conferences, and through open-source contributions to the Unikraft unikernel. In addition, I created and shared tools for others, like my open-source bibliography manager [bibli-ls](https://github.com/kha-dinh/bibli-ls). These outreaching efforts exposed me to like-minded researchers and built long-lasting connections that expanded beyond research. I am eager to continue this trajectory at UBC, where cross-disciplinary engagement is the norm.

Teaching is one of the most meaningful forms of collaboration -- one between the students and the teacher. As a teaching assistant for Computer Security and System Programming at SKKU, I developed [ctf.skku.edu](ctf.skku.edu), a platform that enables students to participate in Capture-The-Flag (CTF) challenges modeled after real-world cybersecurity competitions. The platform ignited many students' interest in cybersecurity, with several going on to join SSLab. Maintaining the system also required me to carefully balance usability, security, and scalability -- concerns closely tied to my research -- and showed me how creativity and interactivity make learning more rewarding. Outside the classroom, I cultivate this creativity through pixel art and video game development, and have even published [a few games of my own](https://cafemanhzu.itch.io/). Effort invested in teaching is never wasted: it connects me with the next generation of researchers, strengthens my own understanding of difficult concepts, and brings me the fulfillment of witnessing students' growth. I am excited to contribute to UBC's teaching mission by making notoriously complex subjects, such as operating systems, engaging. To this end, I have already served as a guest lecturer in UBC's own [CPSC 538M: Systems Security](https://aasthakm.github.io/courses/cpsc538m.html), and plan to do the same for its operating systems modules

Having come a long way since first encountering the Spectre and Meltdown attacks as an undergraduate student, I aspire to apply what I have learned to strengthen our security foundations and foster an open and collaborative culture where students and colleagues can thrive. The **Killam Postdoctoral Fellowship** offers a crutial opportunity to carry my mission forward at UBC, providing the stability needed to pursue ambitious research while contributing to the universityâ€™s vibrant academic community.
