It was in the final year of my undergraduate studies at Hochiminh University of Technology, Vietnam, when I became fascinated with systems security after learning about the [Spectre and Meltdown attacks](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42564461) that shook the world in 2018. These attacks revealed how a performance feature like _out-of-order execution_ could be twisted into a _side channel_ to steal secrets like passwords. I was struck by how complex modern processors have become and by how fragile the security foundations of computing truly are.

Naturally drawn to such challenges, I delved deeper into cybersecurity, starting with my Bachelor's thesis on data crowdsourcing for security. With limited access to advanced education in my home country, I pursued my Ph.D. at the [Systems Security Lab (SSLab)](https://sslab.skku.edu/) of Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU), South Korea. From 2019 to 2025 at SSLab, I took the first steps toward strengthening the security foundations of computing. Along the way, I was recognized with the **Distinguished Paper Award at the ACM CCS 2023** and the Korean government's **BK21 Research Scholarship in 2024** for my work on software security through compartmentalization. Most meaningful to me was returning to the problem that first sparked my interest: side-channel attacks. Our solution was featured at the **IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy 2025** -- a milestone I had only dreamed of when I first began this journey. Looking back, these achievements were possible because of the ideas, critiques, and encouragement I received from others. More than the recognition, these experiences taught me that advances in science are a collective effort.

Collaborations only flourish with initiative and persistence. As Richard Hamming observed in [his lecture](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html), the scientists who leave doors open (and welcome interruptions) often make the most impactful contributions. Conducting research in a geographically isolated environment, I am motivated to be proactive: I independently seek out international projects, including one with UBC's [Systopia lab](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/). In parallel, I contributed to the broader field through service on artifact evaluation and poster committees at major conferences. I also engaged in open-source work, participating in security discussions and implementing new features for the Unikraft unikernel. Through open-source, I also created tools for others, such as my bibliography manager, [bibli-ls](https://github.com/kha-dinh/bibli-ls). These outreach efforts expanded my horizons, exposed me to like-minded researchers, and built long-lasting connections that extended beyond research. The [collaborative, respectful, and inclusive](https://strategicplan.ubc.ca/strategy-10-research-culture/) being built at UBC deeply resonates with me, and I am eager to contribute to its vibrant academic community.

Teaching has been one of my most rewarding forms of collaboration -- one between the teacher and students. As a teaching assistant for Computer Security and System Programming at SKKU, I developed [ctf.skku.edu](ctf.skku.edu), a platform that enables students to participate in Capture-The-Flag (CTF) challenges, modeled after real-world cybersecurity competitions. The platform sparked the interest of many students in cybersecurity, with some later joining SSLab. Maintaining the system required me to carefully balance usability, security, and scalability -- concerns closely tied to my research. It also showed me how creative representations make learning more engaging. Outside of the classroom, I nurture this creativity through pixel art and interactive projects such as [video games](https://cafemanhzu.itch.io/) and [security algorithm visualization](https://github.com/kha-dinh/ORAM-Visualization). The effort invested in teaching is never wasted: it connects me with the next generation of researchers, strengthens my understanding of complex concepts, and brings me the fulfillment of witnessing students' growth. I am excited to contribute to UBC's teaching mission by making notoriously difficult subjects, such as operating systems, engaging. To this end, I have already served as a guest lecturer in UBC's own [CPSC 538M: Systems Security](https://aasthakm.github.io/courses/cpsc538m.html), and plan to do the same for its operating systems modules

Having come a long way since first encountering the Spectre and Meltdown attacks as an undergraduate student, I aspire to lead research that strengthens our security foundations and fosters an open and collaborative culture. The **Killam Postdoctoral Fellowship** offers a crucial opportunity to carry my mission forward at UBC. The fellowship's stability will provide the necessary support for me to pursue ambitious research that aligns with the fellowship's objectives and my own aspirations.
