I first became fascinated with systems security in the final year of my undergraduate studies at Hochiminh University of Technology, Vietnam, where I learned about the [Spectre and Meltdown attacks](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42564461), which shook the world in 2018. These attacks demonstrated how _out-of-order execution_, a feature ubiquitous in modern processors for performance, could be exploited through _side-channel attacks_ to leak secrets like personal passwords. Two things struck me: the arcane complexity of modern processors, and the fragile security foundations upon which we build our computing systems!

My fascination led me to pursue a Bachelor's thesis in cybersecurity. Coming from a developing country with limited access to advanced education, I joined [Systems Security Lab (SSLab)](https://sslab.skku.edu/) at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU), South Korea, as a Ph.D. student. From 2019 to 2025, I practiced the art of designing secure systems, which resulted in research papers published at leading venues such as the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) and the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy. Eventually, one of my projects got to address side-channel vulnerabilities, the very class of attack that first drew me into systems security. One of my proudest moments was having my paper recognized with the **Distinguished Paper Award** at the prestigious ACM CCS 2023. This journey not only prepared me as a competent researcher but also profoundly shaped how I think about research itself.

My experiences taught me that teaching and research are complementary. As a teaching assistant for Computer Security and System Programming at SKKU, I built [ctf.skku.edu](ctf.skku.edu), a platform where students could participate in _Capture-The-Flag (CTF)_ challenges modeled on real-world cybersecurity competitions. The platform ignited many students' interest in cybersecurity, with several going on to join SSLab. Moreover, maintaining the system required me to balance usability, security, and scalability carefully -- concerns closely tied to my research. I realized that the effort invested in teaching is never wasted: it connects me with the next generation of researchers, strengthens my own understanding of complex concepts, and brings me the fulfillment of witnessing the students' growth. At UBC, I am excited to contribute to its teaching mission. To this end, I have already served as a guest lecturer in UBC's own [CPSC 538M: Systems Security](https://aasthakm.github.io/courses/cpsc538m.html), and planing to do the same for its operating systems modules.

I have also learned that real progress comes when diverse perspectives meet -- as Richard Hamming noted in [his lecture](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html), the scientists who work with their doors open often made the most impactful contributions. Conducting research in environments with limited collaboration opportunities motivated me to be proactive: I sought out international projects with collaborators worldwide, including one with UBC's [Systopia lab](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/). I contributed to the broader field through service on artifact evaluation and poster committees at major conferences, and through open-source contributions to the Unikraft unikernel. I also created and shared tools for others, like my open-source bibliography manager [bibli-ls](https://github.com/kha-dinh/bibli-ls). These efforts exposed me to different ideas and taught me that fruitful collaborations are built on initiative. I am eager to continue this ethos at UBC, where cross-disciplinary engagement is the norm.

Finally, I believe creativity in research is as important as rigor. In my free time, I cultivate this by making pixel art and exploring video game development -- a pursuit that balances programming with artistic design. I have even published [a few games of my own](https://cafemanhzu.itch.io/). These projects shape my teaching philosophy: I aim to bring the playfulness and interactivity of games, as shown in [ctf.skku.edu](ctf.skku.edu), into the classroom, making learning more engaging and rewarding for students.

I have come a long way since first encountering the Spectre and Meltdown attacks as an undergraduate student. Along the way, I have not only earned valuable experiences but also clarified my vision as a researcher. Looking forward, I aspire to apply what I have learned to strengthen our security foundations and foster an open and collaborative culture where students and colleagues can thrive. The **Killam Postdoctoral Fellowship** offers an opportunity to carry my mission forward at UBC -- to advance the frontier of systems security while growing into a well-rounded researcher.
