\noindent{}**Research vision.** My vision is to enhance cloud security against adversaries through practical and rigorous approaches. This vision focuses on two main areas: _software compartmentalization_, which involves dividing programs into isolated components, and _confidential computing_, particularly in terms of hardening it against side-channel attacks. I have proposed solutions that have been widely recognized by the research community. My work on compartmentalization with hardware mechanisms earned the _Distinguished Paper Award at the ACM CCS 2023_ and the Korean government's _BK21 Research Scholarship_ in 2024. More recently, my solution for practically addressing side-channel attacks in the cloud was featured at the _IEEE S&P 2025_, a premier conference in computer security.

Leveraging the cross-disciplinary research culture at UBC, I aspire to expand this vision toward new methodologies and emerging problems. Under the guidance of my postdoctoral supervisor, _Aastha Mehta_, I will initiate collaborations with systems researchers at UBC's _Systopia Lab_, developing operating system-supported solutions to secure cloud confidential computing. In particular, I see strong connections with the work on system provenance by _Margo Seltzer_ and _Thomas Pasquier_, and on application-aware memory management by _Alexandra Fedorova_. I also plan to build collaborations with the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, especially with _Mohammad Shahrad_, whose expertise in cloud computing will enrich my research. My work to make cloud security more practical can benefit other fields that frequently handle private information in the cloud. For instance, [security compliance and cybersecurity](https://mednet.med.ubc.ca/announcements/community-update/introducing-the-new-faculty-of-medicine-it-governance-security-policy/) have been one of the challenges for the Faculty of Medicine, and interdisciplinary research collaboration could be initiated to create streamlined and secure medical research workflows.

\vspace{0.4em}\noindent{}**Leadership and community engagement.** A good researcher is an outreaching one; as Richard Hamming observed in [his lecture](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html), the scientists who leave doors open often make the most impactful contributions. Basing research in a geographically isolated location, I am motivated to be proactive: I independently sought out and participated in international projects with researchers from Systopia Lab and CISPA, Germany. At the same time, I contributed to the broader field through service on artifact evaluation and poster committees at major conferences, which earned me the _Noteworthy Reviewer Recognition_ at Usenix Security 2025. I also engaged in open-source work, participating in security discussions and implementing new features for the Unikraft unikernel. Through open-source, I also created tools for others, such as my bibliography manager, [bibli-ls](https://github.com/kha-dinh/bibli-ls). These outreach efforts expanded my horizons and built long-lasting connections that extended beyond research. I am eager to continue my outreach trajectory at UBC, where a [collaborative, respectful, and inclusive research culture](https://strategicplan.ubc.ca/strategy-10-research-culture/) is being built.

\vspace{0.4em} \noindent{}**Teaching.** The most effective learning is achieved through _interactivity_. As a teaching assistant for _Computer Security_ and _System Programming_ at SKKU, I developed and maintained [ctf.skku.edu](http://ctf.skku.edu), a platform where students can participate in _Capture-the-Flag (CTF)_ events modeled after real-world cybersecurity competitions. This game-like approach to teaching security not only ignited the curiosity of many students but also motivated several of them to join my lab. The platform not only connects me with the next generation of researchers but also enhances my own understanding of complex concepts in cybersecurity. At UBC, I plan to bring my CTF-organizing experiences to UBC's [MapleBacon](https://maplebacon.org/) CTF team and to courses such as [CPSC 538M: Systems Security](https://aasthakm.github.io/courses/cpsc538m.html), where I have already served as a guest lecturer.

Students learn best when they can connect abstract concepts to intuitive understanding, and _visualization_ is a powerful tool for this. At UBC, I plan to expand my visualization skill set, building on my experiences developing [video games](https://cafemanhzu.itch.io/) and visualizing [security algorithms](https://github.com/kha-dinh/ORAM-Visualization). I aim to visualize abstract security concepts such as compartmentalization and side channels to make learning more engaging and intuitive. Toward this goal, I will collaborate with visualization researchers at UBC, such as _Ivan Beschastnikh_, who has worked on visualizing distributed systems, and _Tamara Munzner_, an expert in visualization techniques. Outside of teaching, I also intend to assist students in creating visualizations for their research projects, as good visualization significantly increases the understandability and impact of the research.
